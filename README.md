OPEN FORTS

The classic GMOD gamemode remade in S&box AND MORE!
This is a now abandoned project created by Kick's Collective.  Originally it was intended to be worked on for much longer but we ultimately decided to end the project and open source it.
Feel free to use the code how you would like (it is under MIT), but be warned a lot of it is janky and messy so I would like to apologise for that.
We will be updating this code when Facepunch commits engine changing features but not adding anything new to it.
Thanks, and have fun!
